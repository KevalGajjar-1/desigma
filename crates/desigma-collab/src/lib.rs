//! Live collaboration core: pure, synchronous, no network. See `docs/collaboration.md`.
//!
//! Edits are found by diffing the document against a shadow copy of the last synced state
//! ([`diff`]) and expressed as [`Op`]s. The host ([`HostSession`]) validates, orders and
//! broadcasts them; guests ([`GuestSession`]) apply their own edits at once, hold back remote
//! writes to fields with unacknowledged local changes, and settle on the host's order. A
//! transport only has to carry [`ClientMsg`] / [`ServerMsg`] as JSON.
